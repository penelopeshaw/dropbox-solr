Penelope Shaw Elkins Park, PA 19027 | 215-498-6201 | pss324@lehigh.edu October 17, 2023 Dear Hiring Manager , My name is Penelope Shaw , and I am a senior at Lehigh University in the Computer Science and Business Honors Program. I am very interested in becoming an operations engineer at Duolingo. Given my strong technical experience, I have the skill set needed to be successful. This summer , I worked as a Software Engineering Intern at Nationwide Inc. Using the Agile methodology , my primary assignment is to create new APIs for the Account Register application by refactoring code from Spring to Spring Boot. I shared my progress on my Jira cards during daily stand ups and created flow documentation for my work in Visio. I also attended daily intern sync-up meetings to receive individual feedback from my mentors. I used languages and technologies including Java, Spring Boot, SQL Developer , Liquibase, Docker , Maven, and more. To conclude the internship, I showcased a summary of my experiences, tools utilized, and overall progress to company leaders. Currently in school, for my year-long capstone project, I am working on a team with three other students to implement powerful changes to a search engine application for AEquitas, a non-profit legal organization dedicated to reducing gender -based violence and human trafficking. Our team uses Apache Solr, Vue.js 3, and AWS to support our application. During the spring semester , I researched the tools needed for semantic search, including BER T Tokenizers, developed several prototype semantic search functions, and implemented a PDF extraction tool. During this fall semester , I am using the Dropbox API to directly connect AEquitas' Dropbox to our Solr search engine, creating Python scripts to automatically index files on a daily basis. Duolingo has been my dream company to work at ever since I started studying because of its mission and strong values. I am passionate about language learning, and am an avid user of Duolingo to maintain my Spanish knowledge and to learn Mandarin. Expanding access to education is a goal that would encourage me to work my hardest to help achieve. I also practice Duolingo' s 12 operating principles in my current technical work; I emphasize test-driven development and reducing complexity whenever possible. I work hard to ensure my code is of the highest quality and build trusting, strong relationships with my mentors and colleagues. I am confident my technical and business experience will push me to create high quality work at Duolingo. Thank you for your consideration; I look forward to hearing from you. Best regards, Penelope Shaw
